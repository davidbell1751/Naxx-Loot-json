# Naxx-Loot-json
Conversion of a csv file to json for web data management

Using the python language I took the loot database from our world of warcraft raids and converted it to a csv.  I then used this program to transfer that csv to a json.  The JSON format is a great way to share and parse data.  To Query the data you can place the created json into a sql server.
